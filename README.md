# Leave_Request_Handling_System
Joint project for Programming in .NET course at Military University of Technology
# Description
This project simulates a leave request handling system. The employee has a given number of available leave days. They can create one of the two types of leave requests: basic leave request, upon acceptance of which makes the employee lose the amount of leave days for which the leave was issued, or a sick leave request, which if accepted does not make the employee lose ther leave days. The sick leave request can be issued with or without doctor's certificate. The employer's process manages their employees' requests - after reviewing the request it is sent back to the employee that sent it with a description (description is not needed if the request is approved). Communication between the two processes is asynchronus and takes place by writing to/reading from the project root.
# Specific requirements
A specific requirement for the configuration of the environment to run and dynamic evaluation of the solution is that the location of the .txt files should remain in the the default project folder.
# Used technologies
